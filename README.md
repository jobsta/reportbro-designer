# ReportBro Designer

A javascript plugin to create PDF and XLSX report templates.

ReportBro Designer can be easily integrated into your web application. Everyone can design & edit document templates, and preview them directly in the browser. The reports can be generated with
[ReportBro Lib](https://github.com/jobsta/reportbro-lib) (a Python package) on the server.

See the ReportBro project website on https://www.reportbro.com for full documentation and demos.

## Build

### prerequisites:

Install Node.js and npm.

Troubleshooting for Ubuntu/Linux: If you get an error like "/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory" you can easily fix it with a symbolic link:

`ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`

Go to reportbro-designer root directory and install node modules:

`npm install`

### development:

`npm run build`

This is a fast way to build ReportBro Designer and easily debug the code. You can use the generated reportbro.js file from the dist folder in any modern browser supporting ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).

### production:

`npm run build-prod`

Transpiles javascript code from ES6 to ES5 to support older browsers and minifies the generated js file. Use this build step to generate ReportBro Designer for production environment.

## Notes

### Running demos from local filesystem

You need to run

`npm run build-prod`

at least once before starting any local demos. This build step creates ReportBro Designer in the `dist` directory which is referenced in the demos.
