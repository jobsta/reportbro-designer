# ReportBro Designer

A javascript plugin to create PDF and XLSX report templates.

ReportBro Designer can be easily integrated into your web application. Everyone can design & edit document templates, and preview them directly in the browser. The reports can be generated with
[ReportBro Lib](https://github.com/jobsta/reportbro-lib) (a Python package) on the server.

See the ReportBro project website on https://www.reportbro.com for full documentation and demos.

## Basic usage

Go to the [docs](https://www.reportbro.com/doc/api) for more information. There are demos for different use cases available at: https://www.reportbro.com/demo/invoice.

Include the ReportBro, jQuery, Autosize, JsBarcode, Spectrum JavaScript files as well as the ReportBro and Spectrum stylesheets in the `<head>` of your page. Make sure to load jQuery before ReportBro's JavaScript. 

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/spectrum/1.8.0/spectrum.min.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="reportbro/reportbro.css"/>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/spectrum/1.8.0/spectrum.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/autosize.js/3.0.20/autosize.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsbarcode/3.8.0/JsBarcode.all.min.js"></script>
<script src="reportbro/reportbro.js"></script>
```

Place an empty div within the `<body>` of a web page:
```html
<div id="reportbro"></div>
```

Initialize ReportBro:
```html
    <script type="text/javascript">
       $(document).ready(function() {
          $("#reportbro").reportBro();
       });
    </script>
````

## Build

### prerequisites:

Install Node.js and npm.

Troubleshooting for Ubuntu/Linux: If you get an error like "/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory" you can easily fix it with a symbolic link:

`ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`

Go to reportbro-designer root directory and install node modules:

`npm install`

### development:

`npm run build`

This is a fast way to build ReportBro Designer and easily debug the code. You can use the generated reportbro.js file from the dist folder in any modern browser supporting ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).

### production:

`npm run build-prod`

Transpiles javascript code from ES6 to ES5 to support older browsers and minifies the generated js file. Use this build step to generate ReportBro Designer for production environment.

## Notes

### Running demos from local filesystem

You need to run

`npm run build-prod`

at least once before starting any local demos. This build step copies the external plugins to the ../dist/ext folder
which are referenced in the demos.

### Running demos from local filesystem with Firefox

Because of Firefox's strict origin policy the icon fonts cannot be loaded (from ../dist/iconfonts)
with default settings. Go to `about:config` and make sure
`security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` is set to false.

### Testing with MS Edge on localhost

You have to enable loopback first

`CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n=Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe`
